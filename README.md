## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/johnnieWa1ker/DEMO-JSON-Parser.git
cd DEMO-JSON-Parser
pod install
open DEMO-JSON-Parser.xcworkspace # or xed .
```

## 🎉 Why am I building this?
1. I wanted to better understand how the parsing mechanism works, while not using the Codable protocols.
1. This task is one of the most common in interviews. I wanted to save time both for myself and for the person who needs to learn my current programming skills. 
1. Fun thing! 😋
